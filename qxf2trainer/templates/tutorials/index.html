<p class="text-justify">Welcome to Qxf2 Trainer - this screen is the start of your journey towards becoming a more technical tester. This training program has been created by testers for other testers. We have made many tweaks to our training program to incease the odds that you actually stick to this program. 
<br><br>

<h3 class="thin-text"><img src="https://qxf2.com/assets/img/setup_icon.png" width="60" height="60"> SETUP</h3><p class="text-justify">There are many other nice features to our program that you will discover as you work through our exercises. But before you begin, please follow all the instructions in the setup section of this page. Don't be scared if you have tried previously and failed. We wrote the setup guides assuming things would go wrong and that you would need help troubleshooting problems.
<br><br>In this section, you will be guided to setup your environment. Proceed in order. Click on the first link/task that you are yet to complete.</p>
