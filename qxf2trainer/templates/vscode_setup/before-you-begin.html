<p class="text-justify">We will use Visual Studio Code for writing our code. Think of it as your favorite notepad .... except optimized to write code. It makes it easy to read code, search for code, has auto-complete so you don't need to remember a whole lot and it does a great job of pointing any silly syntax mistakes you might make. It also makes it easy for code formatting , refactoring and debugging. Once you get used to the layout and learn a few keyboard shortcuts, you will begin to love it! </p>

<p>We would like to remind you of a few things:
    <ol>
        <li>It is OK to run into issues during this step. Setup issues are a part of regular work.</li>
        <li>It is OK to not know what you are doing. Things will come together later in the course.</li>
    </ol>

</h3>
<p>Until you have the momentum of several small technical accomplishments, take a moment to figure out how you are feeling. This exercise will help you combat some unrealistic defense mechanisms at a later date!</p>
